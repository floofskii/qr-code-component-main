## Overview

The above code is an HTML document that displays a QR code component. It includes a meta tag for setting the viewport, a link to a favicon image, and some inline CSS styles for styling the component. The component consists of an image of a QR code with some text below it, and an attribution section at the bottom of the page. The CSS styles include some media queries to adjust the layout and image size based on the device screen size.

### What I learned

I learnt about the HTML structure and how to use html tags such as meta, title, div etc and also how to demonstrate the use of CSS to style HTML elements, including background color, border, padding, margin, font, etc.


Responsive design: including media queries that adjust the layout of the page based on the screen size of the device.

Image optimization: understanding  how to optimize images for the web by setting a specific size and format.

Accessibility: including an alt attribute for the image, which is important for accessibility purposes.

Overall, this code taught me a good foundation for understanding how HTML and CSS work together to create a webpage with basic functionality and styling.
